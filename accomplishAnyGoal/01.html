        <br>
        <p>Have you ever set a goal and created a detailed to-do list but failed to accomplish it? I bet everyone did it at some point of their life. Accomplish any goal, including mastering an instrument, passing an exam or getting fit is not
          simply a to-do
          list. Instead, the recipe to success has many other ingredients: mentorship, proper planning, motivation, goal setting, progress tracking, consistency, work ethics etc. Most apps focus on one piece of puzzle, but fail to include others. We
          want
          to know if we can leverage technology to support whoever wants to accomplish a long-term goal. Therefore, we propose our design question as the following: </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold"> “How to use interactive technology to help support users reach their long-term goal?”

          <p class="research">Before we jump into the desiging phase, we need to figure out what users need, and what already exists on the market. So we started off our researching questions as the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What make people fail a long-term goal?</li>
            <li>What are helpful to help people to reach a long-term goal?</li>
            <li>What areas do people think they need to get better when working toward a goal?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We interviewed 5 people across different occupations to find out what's the pain point of their jouney.</p>
          <p>We also conducted competitive analysis and searched for the related apps that exist on the market. Most apps focus on:
            <ul>
              <li>Visualization of the progress (chart, check boxes and calendar)</li>
              <li>Set daily reminder</li>
              <li>Divide big goals into smaller tasks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            <p>As shown on the left side, though each person have different emphasis on what they think they need, in reality, they are all intertwined with each other. It does not mean people only need help only in one area throughout their
              journey. Because each user's intuition
              and experiences are completely unquie, it explains that different people's demands are particular in their diverse areas.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Key Findings & Insights</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">(1) People need different help in different stages of their journey to succeed</p>

        <p>Focusing on one aspect of accomplishing a long term goal in the app could be a good choice, which many app developer have already made. For example, many apps focus on forming a good habit. We decided to have a variety of tools for user
          to choose from
          . Therefore, the design question becomes <span class="fond-weight-bold">how to make our product or services seamless, simple but not overwhelming for users to use</span>.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">(2) The social components seem to be missing in most of apps/websties.</p>

        <p>According to situated learning theories, people learn by socializing with others. ZPD theory (Zone of Proximal Development) showed that people can do more with the help of an experienced pioneer or peer. Therefore, another design question
          is how can we
          bring the social elements into our product, making sure it helps our users move toward their goals.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">(3) Simplicity, fun, visually appealing, sense of progress are the key words. </p>

        <p>Through interviews, "simplicity", "fun", and "visually appealing" are extremely common words that users describe that appeals them the most to an application. This indicated to us that design should be focus on the ease of human-computer
          interaction. Progress should be visual presented, but also in a motivating way. After
          all, working towards a main goal is already complicated, so why should users need to spend the extra effort figuring out how to use our product?</p>

          <p class="research">According to our research, our team tried to come up with something that both meet user needs, but also fun to engage with. We think we could apply some gamification in our design so user can see how their daily actions
            contributing to an over-arching
            long-term goal. Through team brainstorm and discussions, as shown on the left side, we came up with more than 10 possible design solutions. Since we are also the web developer for this project and we are on a tight timeline, we had to
            give
            up some cool ideas and turned to more simple and realistic ones that can do the job but also meet the timeline. </p>

          <p>
            Here are the key elements we decided that have to be incorportaed into our design:
            <ul>
              <li>Start with defining proper goal</li>
              <li>Divide the goals in to milestone or stepstones</li>

              <p class="font-weight-bold">More time should be invested in the research phase.</p>
              <p>When we went into the brain storming and designing phase, we encounter occasions that design decisions couldn't be made firmly due to the lack of understanding of user behaviors. Then we realised we actually need to invest more time
                and be more
                strategic in the research phase. Lessons are learned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">Understand who is the product desgined for and what's the purpose of this products.</p>
              <p>During user testing, we had a chance to hear different voices and opinions. For example, one user would like to use this tool as a to-do list, and the goals she put in the system were small items and she hoped she
                could see all the tasks on the screen. We could have easily decided that we should build a feature to display all the tasks, but do we really need to? Does that really help people focus on their long term goals? I still don't have an
                answer yet. It's really tempting to add more
                and more into our product, but I am a firm believer of "less is more". I am glad that me and my teammates are always on the same channel and we have to remind us "Keep it simple" and "What problem did we try to solve".
